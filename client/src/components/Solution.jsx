        The patient is given a pen and a paper and he is asked to draw an analog
        clock on it and show the time "11:10"
      </li>
      <li className="my-3">
        Based on how the patient draws ,a medical practitioner can detect the
        chances of the patient suffering from dementia
      </li>
      <li className="my-3">
        My solution uses the proven clock drawing test and digitalizes it using
        high precision deep leaning models to facilitate early detection of
        dementia and other neurocognitive diseases.
